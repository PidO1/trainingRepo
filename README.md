# trainingRepo

The basic premise behind this repo is to facilitate training of the mini-program framework for Vodacom Finanical Services to fast track the merchant process of developing their own mini-programs for the new Vodacom Platform.

## What is Mini-program?
**Mini-program** is a platform that utilises a **single** app on a device and allows various smaller apps to reside on the super app which is installed on the native device, allowing these smaller apps to act as view layers and store fronts to market and sell services or games, these mini-apps are allowed to invoke payments services through super app allowing the the merchant to focus only on the basic UI journey of marketing and selling products, hence allowing for a much faster developer cycle. The extra added benefit is the fact thta these mini-app do not go through conventional channels to be allowed onto the app store(IOS) and the google play store ,only the super app has to got through that process, however, Vodacom does internally scrutinise the apps that will be published to ensure the highest quality user experience is upheld.
